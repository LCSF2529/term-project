                    In 2024, in the innovative city of Sarnia, Ontario, a team of engineers, builders, and design specialists 
                    set out to redefine the standards of professional cutting tools. Months of dedicated development led to the 
                    creation of the first ForgeWorks Precision series—compact, durable cutting tools built with advanced engineering 
                    and user-focused design.
